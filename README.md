Order [here](https://www.pcbway.com/) today.

The boards manufactured by PCBWay had quality that exceeded my expectations.  
The silk screen was less smudged and noticeably more detailed than other fab houses I've used before. All 5 of the boards in my order had no defects, both cosmetic, and functionally.   

The shipping was also insanely quick; I live overseas from China, despite that, with standard shipping the boards were at my place within 2 weeks of uploading the gerbers.    
Their website also had an easy to follow [guide](https://www.pcbway.com/blog/help_center/Generate_Gerber_file_from_Kicad.html) on the settings they require for generated gerbers, this made ordering a breeze. Their [capabilities page](https://www.pcbway.com/capabilities.html) was also easy to follow for setting the constraints within KiCad.  

Overall, I was very satisfied with the result, I'll definitely be using them for any future projects.

# Gerber Files
Generated gerber and drill files can be found within the gerbers.7z archive.   
These files were generated according to PCBWay's desired settings, thus, they can be used to order the boards from them without re-plotting.
